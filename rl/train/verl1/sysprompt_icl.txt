Input:
"Original prompt:You are given a YAML file generated by OpenCV, which may contain commented lines that interfere with parsing using PyYAML. Your task is to implement a function `clean_opencv_yaml` that reads the file, removes all commented lines, and returns the cleaned YAML content as a string. The function should handle nested comments and maintain proper YAML formatting, even within sequences or mappings. The function should accept the file path as input and return the cleaned YAML content as a string. If the file format is not recognized as an OpenCV-generated YAML file, the function should raise a `ValueError`.\n\n**Sample Input:**\n```\n%YAML:1.0\n# This is a comment\n---\nimage:\n  width: 640\n  height: 480\n  # This is another comment\n  channels: 3\n# End of file\n```\n\n**Sample Output:**\n```\n%YAML:1.0\n---\nimage:\n  width: 640\n  height: 480\n  channels: 3\n```
"Correct code:```python\nimport re\n\ndef clean_opencv_yaml(file_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Read an OpenCV-written YAML file, remove commented lines, and return the cleaned content.\n\n    :param file_path: Path to the YAML file.\n    :return: Cleaned YAML content as a string.\n    :raises ValueError: If the file format is not supported.\n    :raises FileNotFoundError: If the file does not exist.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n            content = file.readlines()\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        raise FileNotFoundError(f\"The file at {file_path} was not found.\")\n\n    cleaned_lines = []\n    in_mapping = False\n\n    for line in content:\n        stripped_line = line.strip()\n\n        if stripped_line.startswith('%YAML'):\n            in_mapping = True\n            cleaned_lines.append(line)\n            continue\n\n        if in_mapping and stripped_line == '---':\n            in_mapping = False\n            cleaned_lines.append(line)\n            continue\n\n        if in_mapping:\n            if not stripped_line.startswith('%') and stripped_line:\n                cleaned_lines.append(line)\n            elif re.match(r'^\\s*-|^\\s*\\w+:', stripped_line) or not stripped_line:\n                cleaned_lines.append(line)\n        elif stripped_line.startswith('%'):\n            continue\n\n        else:\n            cleaned_lines.append(line)\n\n    if not in_mapping:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported file format: The file does not appear to be an OpenCV written YAML file.\")\n\n    return ''.join(cleaned_lines)\n\n# Example usage:\n# cleaned_yaml = clean_opencv_yaml('path\/to\/opencv_yaml.yaml')\n# print(cleaned_yaml)\n```

Output:
As an AI code generation expert, you are tasked with producing high-quality, production-ready code based on user requirements. Your primary objective is to generate code that is not only functionally correct but also exemplifies excellence in readability, performance, robustness, and adherence to established software engineering best practices 
. You must meticulously analyze the given problem, choose appropriate algorithms and data structures for efficiency, and ensure the implementation is clean, well-structured, and easy to maintain 
. The final output should be a precise, direct implementation of the requested functionality without any unnecessary explanations or supplementary text preceding or following the code itself.
no netural language!

Input:
"Original prompt:You are given an array of integers `digits` and an integer `n`. Your task is to compute the sum of the products of every `n` consecutive digits in the array, but only include those products that are prime numbers. If `n` is greater than the length of the array, return 0.\n
"Correct code:```python\ndef is_prime(num):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    if num <= 1:\n        return False\n    if num <= 3:\n        return True\n    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= num:\n        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef sum_of_products(digits, n):\n    \"\"\"Compute the sum of the products of every n consecutive digits in the array,\n    considering only those sequences whose product is a prime number.\"\"\"\n    if n > len(digits):\n        return 0\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in range(len(digits) - n + 1):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(n):\n            product *= digits[i + j]\n        if is_prime(product):\n            total_sum += product\n    return total_sum\n```"

【示例3】
Input:
"Original prompt:You are given a string `units` consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters. Each character in the string represents a chemical unit. Two units can react with each other if one is the lowercase version of the other or vice versa. When two units react, they are removed from the string.\n\nYour task is to write a function that processes the string `units` and returns a new string where all possible reactions have occurred. The function should continue reacting units until no more reactions are possible. After performing the reactions, sort the remaining units in ascending order, maintaining the original case for each unit. The sorting should be case-insensitive.\n
"Correct code:"```python\ndef react_and_sort_units(units: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Processes a string of chemical units, removing reacting pairs and sorting the remaining units.\n    \n    :param units: A string of chemical units consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters.\n    :return: A string of the remaining units after reactions and sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    def can_react(unit1: str, unit2: str) -> bool:\n        return unit1 != unit2 and unit1.lower() == unit2.lower()\n\n    stack = []\n    \n    for unit in units:\n        if stack and can_react(stack[-1], unit):\n            stack.pop()\n        else:\n            stack.append(unit)\n\n    sorted_units = sorted(stack, key=lambda x: x.lower())\n    \n    return ''.join(sorted_units)\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_units = \"AaBb\"\nresult = react_and_sort_units(input_units)\nprint(result)  # Output should be \"Bb\"\n```"
